# Mattermost-Team-EKS

## Background

In my UT Austin Post-Graduate Cloud Computing course, I was given a project assignment to manually deploy an open source team collaboration website called Mattermost connected to a MYSQL database. For extra security, a bastion host design setup was to be used with the database installed on an instance within a private subnet leaving only the Mattermost website exposed to the internet. In addition, the instructions stated that  provisioning of the instances and setting up the network configurations should be done via the AWS Management Console website. As a DevOps Engineer, I had a problem with the manual workflow of the project which made it time-consuming and error-prone. So, I decided to make a few changes. First instead of the AWS Management Console, I will use a popular Infrastructure-as-a-Code tool called Terraform to provision all cloud infrastructure. Next, in lieu of manually installing Mattermost and MYSQL, I will be using containers of both software programs and deploying them within an EKS Kubernetes cluster for high level orchestration. Then, I will securely expose the Mattermost web app to the internet with a custom url using an NGINX Ingress Controller that encrypts data moving in and out of the cluster using Lets Encrypt Certificates issued by Cert Manager deployed within the cluster. Finally, I will deploy Prometheus and Grafana to enable real-time monitoring of the cluster  

## Project Scenario

You are working at a small enterprise with 50 or less employees. To help development teams across the organization collaborate and communicate effectively while aligning with the company’s security policies, the management team has instructed the IT department to launch Mattermost Team Edition. Mattermost is an open source platform that provides secure collaboration for technical and operational teams that work in environments with complex nation-state level security and trust requirements. Mattermost is built specifically for technical and operational use cases, including software development and engineering workflows, and integrates deeply with a rich ecosystem of third-party developer tools. Mattermost gives companies full control over their data; with self-hosted and private cloud deployment options and access to the source code, developers can contribute directly to a shared, flexible, and extensible platform built just for them. With Mattermost Team Edition, the free open-source version, organizations get to enjoy the following benefits:-

-	Teams and channels for one-to-one and group messaging, file sharing, and unlimited search history with threaded messaging, emoji, and custom emoji.
-	Native apps for iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux.
-	Pre-packaged integrations with most common developer tools, including Jira, Confluence, GitHub, GitLab, CircleCI, Zoom, Jitsi, and more.

## Project Implementation

### Step 1: Launch an EC2 instance

- 1 Enter a Name for your instance and choose an OS for your instance. For my example, I used an Ubuntu 22.04 Instance type. This is primarily because as of 05/15/24 the hashicorp repository needed to install Terraform and Vault had not been updated to Ubuntu
24.04.

- 2 Select an Instance Type, Recommended t3.medium, Create a key pair that'll be used to connect to your VM remotely. Select your VPC and security group (Recommend using the Defaults but ensure port 22 is open in the security group or you won't be able to connect to the VM).

- 3 Configure your EBS storage to be greater than the standard 8GB provided for the t3.medium instance as you will need a lot of space to execute the terraform commands. Afterwards, Launch your instance. Then follow the steps to connect remotely to the instance from your terminal. Substituting in your key pair name and instance public dns/ip.
